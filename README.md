# Management repo for R-universe packages from the Carmona Lab

To include a new package, add a new entry to the `packages.json` file.

This should trigger a new build at [https://github.com/r-universe/carmonalab](https://github.com/r-universe/carmonalab).

See the [Actions](https://github.com/r-universe/carmonalab/actions) tab for build status, and the [Dashboard](https://carmonalab.r-universe.dev/builds) for carmonalab packages.
